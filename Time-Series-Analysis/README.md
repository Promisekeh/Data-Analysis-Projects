## Project Overview: Climate Analysis and Visualization

### **Project Title**
**Climate Analysis and Visualization in Delhi**

### **Project Description**
This project analyses and visualises weather data collected from Delhi over several years. The goal is to uncover trends, seasonal patterns, and correlations in weather variables such as mean temperature, humidity, wind speed, and mean pressure. The insights derived from this analysis can be valuable for understanding climate change, urban planning, and improving weather forecasting.

### **Data Source**
- **Dataset**: The dataset consists of daily weather observations, including:
  - Mean Temperature (Â°C)
  - Humidity (%)
  - Wind Speed (km/h)
  - Mean Pressure (hPa)
- **Source**: The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumanthvrao/daily-climate-time-series-data), covering the period from [2013-01-01] to [2017-01-01].

### **Key Objectives**
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Perform descriptive statistics to summarize the dataset.
   - Identify and handle missing values.
   - Visualize the distributions of key weather variables.

2. **Seasonal Analysis**:
   - Analyze seasonal trends in temperature, humidity, and pressure.
   - Visualize seasonal changes using line plots and box plots.

3. **Trend Analysis**:
   - Investigate long-term trends in mean temperature and other weather variables.
   - Use time series analysis techniques to identify significant trends.

4. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Examine correlations between different weather variables.
   - Visualize correlations using scatter plots and heatmaps.

5. **Time Series Plotting**:
   - Create time series plots to visualize the changes in weather variables over time.
   - Implement dual y-axes for multi-variable visualization (e.g., temperature and pressure).

### **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `Pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
  - `Matplotlib`: For data visualization
  - `Seaborn`: For enhanced statistical graphics
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code

### **Key Visualizations**
1. **Mean Temperature and Humidity Trends**: 
   - A line plot showing the mean temperature and humidity over time, highlighting seasonal variations.
  
2. **Wind Speed and Mean Pressure Analysis**:
   - A dual-axis line plot showing wind speed alongside mean pressure, with mean pressure plotted on a logarithmic scale.
  
3. **Percentage Change in Mean Temperature**:
   - A line plot depicting the percentage change in mean temperature, colored to indicate positive and negative changes.

4. **Seasonal Box Plots**:
   - Box plots to display the distribution of temperature and humidity across different months, revealing seasonal patterns.

### **Insights and Findings**
- **Temperature Trends**: The analysis revealed a significant drop trend in mean temperatures between 2016 and 2017.
- **Seasonal Variations**: Seasonal analysis showed distinct patterns in temperature and humidity, with specific months exhibiting higher average temperatures.
- **Correlation**: A strong negative correlation was found between mean temperature and humidity, highlighting the interplay between these variables.

### **Conclusion**
This project effectively demonstrates the ability to analyze and visualize weather data, uncovering meaningful insights that contribute to a better understanding of climatic conditions in Delhi. The visualizations produced not only present the data effectively but also serve as a valuable resource for further research and decision-making.

### **Future Work**
- Implement machine learning models to predict future weather conditions based on historical data.
- Develop an interactive dashboard to present the findings dynamically.
